                    <h2>About the shelter “Cozy House”</h2>
                    <p>Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics 
                        show that only 20% of them will find a family. The
                    others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky 
                    chance to become dearly loved.</p>
                    <p>We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get 
                        sick, feel comfortable (including
                    psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees 
                    of various skill levels. About 12% of the
                    animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become 
                    attached to the pets and would hardly
                    ever leave them alone.</p>
